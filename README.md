# LobbyParkour98 API

Lobby Parkour is a comprehensive Minecraft plugin that adds an engaging and competitive parkour mini-game to your server lobby. Aimed at server owners who want to improve player engagement and retention, this plugin allows players to compete against each other in challenging parkour courses with tracked completion times.

With its API capabilities, it also offers developers the ability to extend and integrate the plugin's functionality into their own projects, giving them full control over the experience they deliver to their server's community.
